1. **Question Storming** - Generate comprehensive questions before seeking answers to properly define the complete problem and solution space
2. **Five Whys** - Drill down through layers of causation to understand root reasons and core problems

## Technique Execution Results

### Question Storming Results

**80+ questions generated across 8 domains:**

#### Domain 1: Users & Patients
- Who exactly is the "patient"? (Age range, tech literacy, health conditions)
- What languages do patients speak? (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, regional)
- How do we handle patients with hearing impairments?
- Do patients have smartphones or just basic phones?
- Who onboards them - kids abroad set it up for their parents?
- What if parent lives alone vs. with spouse or caretaker?
- How many medicines per day are we tracking?
- **Answer:** Two patient types - elderly parents (B2C) and hospital patients (B2B)

#### Domain 2: AI Voice Agent & Calling
- Is the call AI voice or pre-recorded?
- **Answer:** AI voice (real-sounding) powered by ElevenLabs + Twilio
- Does the AI have full conversation or just ask yes/no?
- What if patient says something unexpected like "I fell down"?
- Should AI understand multiple Indian languages?
- Can patient ask AI questions back?
- If patient takes 3 medicines/day, system calls 3 times?
- **Answer:** Yes, based on medicine plan
- What if patient doesn't answer?
- **Answer:** Configurable retry settings per patient
- **Answer:** Call language captured during onboarding (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) - AI speaks in patient's preferred language
- **Answer:** Timezone based on patient location from onboarding

#### Domain 3: Onboarding Flow
- **Answer:** Kids abroad create account and add parent(s)
- **Answer:** Manual medicine entry for now
- **Answer:** AI-assisted medicine entry (user types "paracetamol" → AI maps "paracetamol for fever", suggests related like BP tablets)
- Phone number verified during onboarding
- **Language captured during onboarding - AI calls in patient's preferred language**
- Kids can add both mom AND dad
- **Answer (B2B):** Bulk upload AND one-by-one patient adding
- Kids/hospital can edit medicine list and schedules anytime

#### Domain 4: Dashboard & Reporting
- Who sees dashboard - kids abroad? Hospital? Both?
- What does dashboard show? (Took medicine: Yes/No? Conversation summary? Mood?)
- Can kids see actual conversation transcript?
- Weekly/monthly summary via email or WhatsApp?
- Multiple siblings monitoring same parent?
- Calendar view? (Green = all taken, Red = missed)
- **Answer:** Every conversation stored in MongoDB, periodic refresh dashboard
- **Answer:** Reports generated from conversation data

#### Domain 5: Business & Monetization
- **Answer:** Subscription model
- **Answer (B2C):** Per parent pricing, kid abroad pays
- **Answer (B2B):** Per patient pricing
- **Answer:** Free tier - 2-3 days trial (configurable)
- Minimum subscription price for business viability?
- Break-even patient count?
- Pharma company partnerships? (adherence data)
- Insurance company interest?
- Doctor referral channel?

#### Domain 6: Technical Architecture
- ElevenLabs for AI voice + Twilio for outbound calls
- MongoDB stores every conversation record
- How to handle call costs at scale?
- Can system handle 500 simultaneous calls at peak medicine time (8am)?
- Real-time dashboard updates or periodic refresh?
- **Answer:** Periodic refresh
- AI knows which medicines to ask about based on onboarding data

#### Domain 7: Trust, Safety & Privacy
- What if patient lies about taking medicine?
- What if patient has medical emergency during call?
- India's DPDP Act compliance?
- Health data encryption?
- Call recordings retention policy?
- HIPAA compliance for B2B hospitals?

- What if someone else answers patient's phone?

#### Domain 8: Product Control & Self-Service
- **Answer:** Patients/family can stop calls (pause/opt-out option)
- **Answer:** Can update medicines anytime through dashboard
- **Answer:** Self-service - no support contact needed
- **Answer:** Tracking only in initial phase - no medical suggestions or drug interaction warnings

#### Domain 9: Scale & Edge Cases
- Expected patients: month 1? month 6? year 1?
- 1000 patients × 3 calls/day = 3000 calls/day cost
- ElevenLabs cost per minute?
- Twilio cost per call in India?
- Patient changes phone number?
- Patient hospitalized - pause calls?
- Medicine changes after doctor visit - who updates?
- Two patients share same phone (elderly couple)?
- Patient passes away - sensitive account handling?

### Five Whys Results

**Four root cause analyses completed:**

#### Five Whys #1: "Why do elderly patients miss their medicines?"
1. Nobody is there to remind them consistently
2. Children live abroad and can't be physically present
3. Families migrate for career opportunities, creating geographic separation
4. No affordable, reliable system bridges this distance for daily health monitoring
5. **ROOT:** Existing solutions require tech-savvy users, but elderly patients need something as simple as answering a phone call

#### Five Whys #2: "Why would a hospital pay for this?"
1. Patients don't follow medicine schedules after discharge
2. Hospitals have no way to monitor outpatients at scale
3. Manual follow-up calls by nurses are expensive and inconsistent
4. Readmission from medication non-adherence costs reputation and money
5. **ROOT:** AI voice calls at scale is 100x cheaper than human nurse calls, with better consistency

#### Five Whys #3: "Why would kids choose this over calling their parent daily?"
1. Daily personal calls aren't reliable (busy schedules, time zones)
2. Even when they call, parents say "yes I took it" to avoid worry
3. No structured tracking - just trust and hope
4. AI system creates accountability without emotional guilt
5. **ROOT:** AI removes the emotional awkwardness of nagging your parent about medicine, while providing real data instead of "trust me"

#### Five Whys #4: "Why AI voice and not just an app notification?"
1. Elderly patients in India don't check app notifications
2. Many can't read small text or navigate apps
3. A phone call is natural - they've been answering calls for 50+ years
4. Conversation captures MORE data than a button press (mood, complaints, side effects)
5. **ROOT:** Voice is the most inclusive interface - works for illiterate, visually impaired, and tech-averse users

### Root Insights Summary

| # | Root Insight | Implication |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | "Simple as a phone call" - zero tech barrier | Patient needs NO app, NO smartphone, NO tech skills |
| 2 | "Scale without staff" - AI replaces manual follow-up | Hospital saves 100x on nurse follow-up costs |
| 3 | "Data over guilt" - removes emotional burden | Kids get real tracking data, not guilt-driven nagging |
| 4 | "Voice is the most inclusive interface" | Works for everyone regardless of literacy or tech skills |

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

Dell brought a clear product vision from the start - an AI-powered health monitoring system that bridges the gap between elderly parents in India and their children abroad. The session revealed that the core innovation isn't just the technology, but the insight that voice calls are the most inclusive interface for elderly patients. The Five Whys technique uncovered powerful emotional drivers: guilt-free monitoring for children and dignified health tracking for parents. The B2B hospital angle emerged as equally strong, with clear ROI messaging around replacing expensive manual nurse follow-ups.
