# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Health Discipline AI

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Author:** Dell
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Health Discipline AI is an AI-powered medication adherence monitoring platform that uses automated voice calls to check whether patients have taken their medicines. The system bridges the gap between elderly patients in India and their children living abroad, as well as serving hospitals that need to track outpatient medication compliance at scale.

**Core Value Proposition:** "Simple as a phone call" - patients need zero tech skills, no smartphone, and no app. They simply answer a phone call from a natural-sounding AI voice agent that speaks their language.

**Product Tagline:** Voice is the most inclusive interface.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.0 Onboarding Flow (10-Phase Journey)

> **Reference:** Full interactive blueprint with conversation scripts, state changes, and risk analysis at [healthcare-onboarding-blueprint.jsx](onboarding/healthcare-onboarding-blueprint.jsx)

The onboarding is a **conversational WhatsApp-based flow** (not a traditional form). Total duration: ~15-20 minutes.

| Phase | Name | Duration | Critical | Fields Collected |
|-------|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Discovery | Before Day 0 | No | Phone number (auto from WhatsApp) |
| 1 | Payer Welcome | 2-3 min | YES | Qualifying question (parent/self), relationship |
| 2 | Payer Details | 1-2 min | No | Payer name, location/timezone |
| 3 | Patient Profile | 2-3 min | YES | Patient name, preferred name (how AI addresses them), age, preferred language, digital tier (WhatsApp/feature phone), patient phone number |
| 4 | Health Conditions | 1 min | No | Conditions (multi-select), glucometer availability, BP monitor availability |
| 5 | Medicine Setup | 3-5 min | YES | Per medicine: brand name, generic name, dosage, timing (morning/afternoon/evening/night), with food (before/after/with), patient's nickname for medicine |
| 6 | Family Network | 1-2 min | No | Additional family members (name, phone, relationship), notification preferences per member |
| 7 | Call Schedule | 1 min | No | Call times (mapped to patient's routine), preferred voice gender (male/female) |
| 8 | Payment | 1-2 min | YES | Plan selection (Saathi/Suraksha/Sampurna), payment method |
| 9 | Test Call | 3-5 min | YES | Patient verbal consent (DPDP Act), voice familiarization, data sharing consent |
| 10 | First 48 Hours | Day 1-2 | YES | First 3 call completions, first payer report delivered |

#### Key Onboarding Design Principles

1. **Conversational, not form-based** - WhatsApp chat flow with buttons, not web forms
2. **Every question justified** - Each data point tied to a visible benefit explained to user
3. **Preferred name is the emotional hook** - "Call him Bauji" makes the payer emotionally invested
4. **Medicine nicknames** - AI asks "Bauji, BP wali goli li kya?" in the patient's own language
5. **Test call is mandatory** - Patient hears the voice before Day 1, provides verbal consent
6. **Onboarding isn't done until 3 calls complete** - First 48 hours are make-or-break

### 7.3 Data Flow

```
1. Onboarding:  Kid/Hospital → Add Patient → Enter Medicines → Set Schedule → MongoDB
2. Calling:     Cron Scheduler → Fetch Due Calls → Twilio + ElevenLabs → Call Patient
3. Capture:     AI Conversation → Response Data → Store in MongoDB
4. Reporting:   MongoDB → Generate Report → Display on Dashboard
```

### 7.4 Key MongoDB Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| users | Account holders (kids abroad, hospital admins) |
| patients | Patient profiles (name, phone, language, timezone, location) |
| medicines | Medicine list per patient with schedule |

## 8. Business Model

### 8.1 Revenue Streams

| Stream | Model | Pricing |
|--------|-------|---------|
| B2C | Subscription per parent | TBD (monthly) |
| B2B | Subscription per patient | TBD (monthly) |
| Free Trial | 2-3 days (configurable) | Free |

### 8.2 Cost Structure

| Cost Item | Type | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| ElevenLabs API | Variable (per minute) | AI voice generation per call |
| Twilio | Variable (per call) | Outbound calls to India numbers |
| MongoDB Atlas | Fixed + Variable | Database hosting and storage |
| Hosting (Next.js + NestJS) | Fixed | Vercel/AWS for frontend + backend |
| Payment Gateway | Transaction fee | Per subscription payment |

### 8.3 Unit Economics (To Be Validated)

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost per call | ElevenLabs cost/min + Twilio cost/call |
| Cost per patient/day | (Calls per day) x (Cost per call) |
| Cost per patient/month | Daily cost x 30 |
| Required subscription price | Monthly cost + margin |
| Break-even | Fixed costs / (Price - Variable cost per patient) |

## 9. Assumptions & Constraints

### 9.1 Assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|-----------|
| A-1 | Elderly patients in India are comfortable answering phone calls |
| A-2 | Children abroad are willing to pay for medication monitoring |
| A-3 | ElevenLabs can generate natural-sounding voice in Indian languages |
| A-4 | Twilio supports outbound calls to Indian mobile numbers at reasonable cost |
| A-5 | Patients will respond honestly about medication adherence |
| A-6 | 2-3 minute average call duration per medicine check |
| A-7 | Most patients take 2-5 medicines daily |

### 9.2 Constraints

| # | Constraint |
|---|-----------|
| C-1 | No medical advice or drug suggestions in any phase (regulatory risk) |
| C-2 | Must comply with India's DPDP Act for personal health data |
| C-3 | HIPAA compliance needed if targeting US-based hospitals |
| C-4 | Call costs scale linearly with patient count |
| C-5 | ElevenLabs language support may limit initial language offerings |
| C-6 | Peak call times (morning medicine) may cause concurrent call spikes |

### 9.3 Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| ElevenLabs language quality for Indian languages | High | Test extensively before launch; fallback to pre-recorded |
| Twilio call costs at scale | Medium | Negotiate volume pricing; explore Indian alternatives (Exotel) |
| Patient doesn't answer calls | Medium | Configurable retry; notify family of missed calls |
| Regulatory changes (health data) | High | Build data deletion and export capabilities from day 1 |
| Someone else answers patient's phone | Low | Consider voice verification in future phase |
